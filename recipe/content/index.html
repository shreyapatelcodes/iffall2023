<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>450g self-raising flour</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>100g cold butter, diced</li>
    <li>85g golden caster sugar</li>

<h3>Recipe</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oven to 220C</li>
    <li>Put the flour, salt and butter into a food processor and pulse until you cannot feel any lumps of butter (or rub in butter with fingers). Pulse in the sugar.</li>
    <li>Gently warm the buttermilk (do not throw away the pot) and vanilla in a microwave or pan. Using your largest bowl, quickly tip in some of the flour mix, followed by some of the buttermilk mix, repeating until everything is in the bowl. Use a knife to quickly mix together to form a dough. Do not over-mix it!</li>
    <li>Tip onto a floured surface and lightly bring together with your hands a couple of times. Press out gently to about 4cm thick and stamp out rounds with a 6cm or 7cm cutter. </li>
    <li>Add a splash of milk into the buttermilk pot, then use to glaze the top of each scone. </li>
    <li>Bake for 10-12 mins until golden and well risen.</li>
</ol>

        <p>I like how clean and modern this website feels. The use of a limited color palette means that the full width image of the food shines. I also like the way that ingredients up top, encouraging a mise-en-place style of cooking!</p>

        <p>I love the limited color palette with pops of yellow - it feels so fresh and vibrant. I think the font choices also lend to the playful feeling. I also like the little highlight boxes suggesting alternatives or emphasizing important steps or adding little tips.</p>

        <p>I think adding images to the ingredients list as well as highlighting where to buy them from is a really nice touch. On a specialty recipe that's super helpful. The little video player on the side also adds additional excitement and instruction. I also like the <i>short</i> explanation of what the dish is and what it tastes like up top!</p>

        <p>I like how bright and vibrant all the imagery is. Again, the limited color palette - black, white and one accent - works great to give a clean but playful energy. I think including UGC at the end also makes the vibe of the website feel more attainable.</p>

        <p>I think the way parallax scrolling is used is so fun! I think the colors are really bold and visually exciting. I also think the way images are cropped in non-traditional shapes is also visually interesting.</p>

        <p>I really like the fonts chosen here. The mix between ornate serifed titles and the very stripped down monospace is excellent. I also like the way gifs are used to subtly give the page some motion</p>
