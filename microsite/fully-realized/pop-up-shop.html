      <h2>Pop Up Shop</h1>

            <p>In April 1986, Pop Shop opened in <em>Soho</em>, selling shirts, posters, and other items showing Haring's work. This made Haring's work <em>readily accessible to purchase at reasonable prices</em>. Having achieved what he wanted, which was "getting the work out to the public at large," Haring completely <em>stopped drawing in the subways</em>.  He also stopped because people were taking the subway drawings and selling them.</p>

        <div class="content red">
            <p>Some criticized Haring for commercializing his work. Asked about this, Haring said, "I could earn more money if I just painted a few things and jacked up the price. <em>My shop is an extension of what I was doing in the subway stations, breaking down the barriers between high and low art.</em>" The Pop Shop remained open after Haring's death till 2005; profits went to the Keith Haring Foundation.</p>

            <p>The Pop Shop was far from Haring's only effort to make his work widely accessible. Throughout his career, <em>Haring made art in subways and on billboards</em>. His attempts to make his work relatable can also be seen in his figures' <em>lack of discernable ages, races, or identities</em>. By the arrival of Pop Shop, his work began reflecting more socio-political themes, such as anti-Apartheid, AID awareness, and the crack cocaine epidemic.</p>
