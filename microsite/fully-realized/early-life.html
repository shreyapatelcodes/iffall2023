  <h2>Early Life</h1>

  <div class="content pink">

    <p>Haring was born in <em>Reading, Pennsylvania</em>, on May 4, 1958. He was raised in <em>Kutztown, Pennsylvania</em>, by his mother, Joan Haring, and father, Allen Haring, an engineer and amateur cartoonist. He had three younger sisters, Kay, Karen and Kristen. He became interested in art at a very young age, <em>spending time with his father producing creative drawings.</em></p>

  <div class="content green">
    <p>His early influences included <em>Walt Disney</em> cartoons, <em>Dr. Seuss</em>, <em>Charles Schulz</em>, and the <em>Looney Tunes</em> characters in The Bugs Bunny Show.</p>

    <p>In his early teenage years, he was involved with the <em>Jesus Movement</em>. He later hitchhiked across the country, selling T-shirts he made featuring the <em>Grateful Dead</em> and <em>anti-Nixon</em> designs. He graduated from Kutztown Area High School in 1976.<br> 
      He studied commercial art from 1976 to 1978 at <em>Pittsburgh's Ivy School of Professional Art</em>, but eventually lost interest, inspired to focus on his own art after reading <em>The Art Spirit</em> (1923) by Robert Henri.</p>

  <div class="content green">
    <p>Haring moved to the <em>Lower East Side of New York</em> in 1978 to study painting at the <em>School of Visual Arts</em>. While attending school he studied semiotics with Bill Beckley and experimented with video and performance art.<br>
      Haring first received public attention with his <em>graffiti art in subways</em>, where he created white chalk drawings on black, unused advertisement backboards in the stations. He considered the subways to be his "<em>laboratory</em>," a place where he could experiment and create his artwork and saw the black advertisement paper as a free space and "<em>the perfect place to draw</em>".</p>
