                        <b>Artist:</b> Maisie Peters<br>
                        <b>Album:</b> The Good Witch<br>
                        <b>Genre:</b> Pop<br>
                        <b>Artist's Note:</b> It’s a song about closure and healing and the power of friendship and flowers and flights and wine fuelled kisses with strangers. it’s a song about coming home to yourself after months of fighting your own shadow, a song about finally being happy exactly where you are, no longer wishing yourself back into a past you couldn’t have even if you wanted it. about realising you don’t really want it anymore anyway. It’s a song about letting go, truly and properly, and the magic that can surround you when you do.

                <p>
                    I'm back in London <br>
                    I'm running down Columbia Road<br>
                    They're selling sunflowers cheap<br>
                    I'm reading novels<br>
                    I'm dating but just dating for sport<br>
                    I'm getting coffees for free<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hang all my art<br>
                    And I dance with the coven<br>
                    As the rain falls hard on the street<br>
                    And I, I'm doing better<br>
                    I made it to September<br>
                    I can finally breathe<br>
                    I thought I gave you the best of me but<br>

                    The love we had was covered in snow<br>
                    I had to let it go<br>
                    Yeah, the love we had was eating me whole<br>
                    I had to send it home<br>
                    Oh, there it was, heaven knows<br>
                    There it was, now there it goes<br>

                    I feel it changing<br>
                    I'm young but I am aging and I<br>
                    Need you less than I did<br>
                    I threw a party<br>
                    He kissed me right in front of my friends<br>
                    I felt so far from the cliffs<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I sleep through the night<br>
                    And I go where I'm wanted<br>
                    And I don't need your light to be lit<br>
                    But oh, the way I loved you<br>
                    I will not be embarrassed of that<br>
                    Just should've known when to quit<br>
                    Now I'm over the worst of it 'cause<br>

                <p>
                    A new home, a swan dive<br>
                    A blank page, a rewrite<br>
                    A black cat in the streetlights<br>
                    An open door<br>
                    The comedown of closure<br>
                    The girls and I do yoga<br>
                    I wake up and it's October<br>
                    The loss is yours<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brick lane in the brisk cold<br>
                    And red wine on his hip bone<br>
                    The witching hours of Stockholm that you won't see<br>
                    Sunflowers in the kitchen<br>
                    No heartbreak in remission<br>
                    The universe is shifting<br>
                    And it's all for me, all for me<br>
